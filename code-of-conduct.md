    <p>
    We are deeply committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all conference participants. We value a space where participants feel the agency to collaborate, communicate, and problem-solve, regardless of identity or background. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To support this, we draw on  guiding principles from our sponsoring organizations—including the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="{{ page.sherman_center_link }}">Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="{{ page.hpl_link }}">Hamilton Public Library</a>—to cultivate an enriching environment for all participants. 
    </p>
    <h2>How We Behave</h2>
    <p>
    By attending this conference, participants agree to support the agency of their fellow participants, by: 
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>
    <strong>Being respectful:</strong> We expect everyone to treat others with dignity and fairness. Disagreements are natural, but should be expressed with curiosity and empathy — never through personal attacks or hostility. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Being considerate:</strong> Recognize and respect the diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities within our conference community. Be mindful of differences in language, education, and culture. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Prioritizing community wellbeing:</strong> Our collective aim is to create spaces that are physically, emotionally, psychologically, and culturally safe for all participants and facilitators. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Furthermore, we adopt the Digital Library Federation’s ‘How to Be’ framework, which provides practical guidance for cultivating welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment spaces:  
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>
    listening as much as you speak, and remembering that colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of;
    </li>
    <li>
    encouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group;
    </li>
    <li>
    using welcoming language, for instance by using an individual’s stated pronouns and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (“people,” not “guys”);
    </li>
    <li>
    offer and ask for pronouns; if you are unsure, refer to others by their names;
    </li>
    <li>
    using the name(s) people use for themselves and not names they have gone by in the past;
    </li>
    <li>
    accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively;
    </li>
    <li>
    giving credit where it is due;
    </li>
    <li>
    seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible; and
    </li>
    <li>
    staying alert, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around you.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How We Don't Behave </h2>
    <p>
    Harassment, bullying, and intimidation are strictly prohibited in all our spaces. We reserve the right to remove participants who exhibit disruptive behaviour, which includes but is not limited to:  
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>
    Discriminatory language or actions related to any personal attribute, such as age, race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability   
    </li>
    <li>
    Unwelcome sexual attention or imagery   
    </li>
    <li>
    Deliberate misgendering, doxing (publishing private information without consent), stalking, or inflammatory comments  
    </li>
    <li>
    Any form of physical, psychological, or cultural maltreatment    
    </li>
    <li>
    Violent threats, incitement to violence, or sustained disruption of events or communications 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reporting Concerns </h2>
    <p>Anyone who witnesses or experiences behavior that violates these principles is encouraged to report it to the event organizers. If you prefer to reach out asynchronously, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:mapref@mcmaster.ca">mapref@mcmaster.ca</a>.</p>
