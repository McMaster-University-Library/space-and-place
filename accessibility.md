    Getting to our conference venues is simple and convenient, thanks to Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) transit.

    <h2>Caregiving</h2>
    <p>
    You are welcome to breastfeed your baby wherever you feel most comfortable — there is absolutely no need to seek out a private or secluded space. However, if you prefer a quieter and more private environment, we’re happy to direct you to a designated room for parents and caregivers.
    </p>
    <h2>Allergies, Dietary Restrictions, and Sensitivities</h2>
    <p>
    We’re committed to supporting attendees with food and beverage allergies during registration. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let us know in advance so our catering team can ensure appropriate options are available throughout the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
    To help create a comfortable environment for those with scent sensitivities, we kindly ask attendees to avoid wearing strong perfumes, colognes, or fragranced products.
