# Call for Applications

The Organizing Committee, in collaboration with CARL Portage and McMaster University, invites individuals from across Canada to express their interest in attending part or all of the Canadian Data Curation Forum, being held October 16-18, 2019 in Hamilton, Ontario. 

The SSHRC-funded Forum will consist of two events:  

* **[SPOTS REMAINING]** The Data Curation [Training Event](../agenda#data-curation-training-event) (Wednesday, 16-Oct to Thursday, 17-Oct) will consist of a series of interactive skill-building workshops intended to develop data curation skills in individuals who are responsible for and/or interested in data curation activities. A nominal registration fee will apply to the training event. 

* **[FULL]** The Data Curation [Community-Building Forum](../agenda#-community-building-forum) (Thursday 17-Oct to Friday, 18-Oct) will feature a variety of plenary and discussion sessions intended to build a vision for a national approach to data curation in Canada. Attendees will be active participants in building a national data curation road map during and following the event. There is no registration fee associated with the community-building sessions.

Individuals can use [this application form](https://form.simplesurvey.com/f/s.aspx?s=f211bbb7-29d8-4205-9e2b-1f57e8fe1e1c&lang=EN) to express their interest in attending the Training Event. Applications will be accepted until the end of the day on **Friday, September 6, 2019**. Successful applicants will be contacted shortly thereafter with registration information. 

A limited amount of travel funding remains for students wishing to attend the event who demonstrate financial need.
