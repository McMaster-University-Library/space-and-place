# Call for Applications

The Organizing Committee, in collaboration with CARL Portage and McMaster University, invites individuals from across Canada to express their interest in attending part or all of the Canadian Data Curation Forum, being held October 16-18, 2019 in Hamilton, Ontario. 

The SSHRC-funded Forum will consist of two events: A data curation training event (October 16th and the morning of the 17th) and a community-building forum (afternoon of October 17th and all-day on the 18th). More information for each event may be found on the [agenda](../agenda). Individuals can use [this application form](https://form.simplesurvey.com/f/s.aspx?s=9b3e7481-ba07-4973-952b-d5bd8979e63b&mode=44&lang=EN) to express their interest in attending one or both of the events. All expressions of interest must be submitted by the **end of the day on August 15, 2019** to be considered. Successful applicants will be contacted shortly thereafter with registration information. 

Applicants can apply (through the application form) for limited travel bursaries, which will be made available for attendees from traditionally underrepresented groups and organizations, early-career professionals, and those demonstrating financial need. 

Please send any questions, comments, or requests for more information to [canadiandatacurationforum@gmail.com](canadiandatacurationforum@gmail.com).
