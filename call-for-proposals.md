We are excited to invite proposals that center the greater Hamilton region and celebrate its complexity, creativity, and communities at the inaugural Space and Place Conference. This one-day gathering is dedicated to showcasing and celebrating research, creative work, and community engagement centered on Hamilton’s diverse environments — built, natural, imagined, and remembered.

We welcome contributions that explore storytelling, mapping, art, lived experience, Indigenous knowledge, and other ways of knowing that often exist beyond conventional academic frameworks — in essence, work that reflects and celebrates the geographies where we live, work, and/or study.

<h2 style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 2em;">We welcome proposals from:</h2>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>Community members and organizers</li>

<li>Scholars and researchers (especially early-career or independent)</li>

<li>Artists, creators, and storytellers</li>

<li>Municipal and nonprofit practitioners</li>

<li>Galleries, libraries, archives, and museum (GLAM) workers and information professionals</li>
</ul>

For this call for proposals, we invite contributors to think about Hamilton and its surrounding regions through a critical and creative lens. We strongly encourage all perspectives including those that challenge gendered, racialized, and other marginalized boundaries in their work.

<h2 style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 2em;">Suggested themes include (but are not limited to):</h2>

<li>Environmental histories and ecologies of the greater Hamilton region</li>

<li>Community archives, memory, and spatial justice</li>

<li>Ultimately: let's talk about the greater Hamilton region</li>
</ul>

We invite innovative and alternative forms of presentation, discussion, and engagement. Both scholarly and creative submissions are welcome.

<h2 style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 2em;">Presentation formats may include:</h2>
