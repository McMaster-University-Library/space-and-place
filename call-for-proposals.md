<strong>Location:</strong> Hamilton Public Library Central Library McMaster University's One James North<br>
<strong>Hosted by:</strong> McMaster University Libraries in partnership with Hamilton Public Library and McMaster University’s Office of Community Engagement
<br><br>
We are excited to invite proposals that center the greater Hamilton region and celebrate its complexity, creativity, and communities at the inaugural Space and Place Conference. This one-day gathering is dedicated to showcasing and celebrating research, creative work, and community engagement centered on Hamilton’s diverse environments — built, natural, imagined, and remembered.
<br><br>
We welcome contributions that explore storytelling, mapping, art, lived experience, Indigenous knowledge, and other ways of knowing that often exist beyond conventional academic frameworks — in essence, work that reflects and celebrates the geographies where we live, work, and study.
