The Canadian Association of Research Librariesâ€™ [Portage Network](https://portagenetwork.ca/) in collaboration with [McMaster University Library](https://library.mcmaster.ca/) hosted the SSHRC-funded Canadian Data Curation Forum at McMaster University in Hamilton from October 16 to 18, 2019.

<br />


The goal of the Forum was to establish a national Community of Practice that will catalyze the development/adoption of data curation standards, practices, tools, and skills within and across disciplines and institutions. It brought together library data specialists, research data managers, and discipline and functional experts from a range of institutions and organizations. The Forum integrated a variety of keynote talks, discussions, and workshops to with the objectives of a) facilitating communication and collaboration around data curation practices and standards, and b) developing skill and training resources.
